      "explanation": "Measures how similar a point is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). a(i) is mean intra-cluster distance, b(i) is mean nearest-cluster distance.",
      "context": "**Primary metric for clustering quality**. Range: [-1, 1]. A value near 1 indicates the point is well-matched to its cluster and poorly-matched to neighboring clusters. Near 0 means the point is on or very close to the decision boundary. Negative values indicate potential misclassification. **Higher is better**.",

      "context": "With **window_size=1000**, monitors recent clustering quality. A **sudden decrease** indicates **concept drift** - customer behavior patterns may have changed. Essential for **real-time clustering** where customer segments evolve. **Higher and stable is better**.",

      "context": "With **period=5 minutes**, shows clustering quality for **recent real-world time**. Unlike sample-based rolling, adapts to varying traffic volumes. Sudden drop means customer patterns changed in the last 5 minutes. **Higher and stable is better**.",
